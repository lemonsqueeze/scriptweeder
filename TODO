  - test: - different versions of opera
          - windows.

[ FIXME: relaxed mode issues ]

- github doesn't work by default: needs akamai stuff
  https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/assets/frameworks-cc4895cbb610429d2ce48e7c2392822c33db2dfe.js

- this one would be helpful to have (gets blocked right now)

- imdb is broken needs 
  www.amazon.com

[ FIXME ]

  - cache reload doesn't work sometimes, reload for real after timer ?

  - autohide button + menu onclick -> button shouldn't disappear when menu is shown ...

  - investigate: with 'allow all' (and ghostery running)
    this one uses 'data:text/javascript' urls and the main display is getting
    confused. i suspect a trick to hide third party content there ...

Sites:
  - stackechange.com login page, getting jsarmor error in iframe code
    (is their code interfering ??)
    http://stackexchange.com/users/login?returnurl=%2f#log-in
    
    Event thread: load
    Uncaught exception: TypeError: Cannot convert 'iframe.contentWindow' to object
    Error thrown at line 1404, column 1 in populate_iframe():
        iframe.contentWindow.name = 'noscript_iframe';

    noscript ui not showing up!!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

[ IDEAS ]

- placeholder icon for blocked iframes ?
- bindings to do stuff from opera buttons ?
- use xhtml doctype, this way we can use real xml for ui layout
- can we use css for the layout as well ??
- frameset shows ui everywhere ... forward to biggest frame ?

Features:
- options window, notebook style
- animate/display something on main button to notify about changes ?
  say flash, or blink, small popup, tooltip ...
  (especially important when new script is added after DOM loaded)

- upon new install, could import some default host settings so that
  important sites work out of the box.
  (ex: imdb which is broken even in relaxed mode)

- animate menu!
- could block page event handlers ! (onload onclick ...)
  and javascript urls
- option to build database of scripts used by websites ?
  would be useful for testing
- show script sizes in kb for external scripts loaded
- way to find out about dns aliases in JS ?
- shut the door! block outgoing requests once DOM loaded !!
- show big inline scripts, allow to block them!
- way to make it work when using offline with mht files ?
  (permission problem creating iframe ui...)

- use JSON instead of de/serializing arrays by hand ?
- XSS ??
- Detect / block ajax ?
- display info on startup ? in bottom bar a la noscript or with timer ?
- way to disable / hide ui temporarily ?

Optimization:
  - could cache script storage settings instead of accessing every time
